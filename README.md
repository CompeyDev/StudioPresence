# Installation

• Download [Server Here](https://github.com/iArxic/StudioPresence/releases/tag/v1) and [Roblox Plugin Here](https://www.roblox.com/library/11213975679/StudioPresence)   
• Since the script uses Node, you need to [Install it](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)   
• Next, extract the already installed [Server](https://github.com/iArxic/StudioPresence/releases/tag/v1) and extract the files from the zip.    
• Run the **runner.bat**
    
Note: The cmd window needs to be open in order for the plugin to work!
